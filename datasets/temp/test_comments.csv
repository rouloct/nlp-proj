"I'm sure all of you have heard about the API issues as of late, and the related blackout protest. r/dankmemes supports these blackouts wholeheartedly. However, we will not be closing down our subreddit on June 12th. Instead, we will play the part of the megaphone, voicing our displeasure and stirring conversation.

**Effective June 12th, r/dankmemes will only be allowing memes related to the API protest**.

You can find us on discord while we're doing this: https://discord.gg/dankmemes.

# Ok, that's cool but what is even happening

This situation is... complex. There's quite a lot of historical context involved with where reddit came from, and where it's been going over the past few years.

Reddit started as a pretty simple website, a link aggregator, as it was referred to. Users could post links to stuff *and that was about it*. Then, after that, they added the ability to post comments under the links. Only then did they finally add subreddits. In fact, the first subreddit was just r/reddit.com.

And that was about it for a while, but that was enough to build a vibrant community. Other services were able to fill the needs of hosting. YouTube hosted video, imgur was *created by a redditor* to host images, articles were hosted wherever articles were hosted. Even the community moderators came for free.

*This* is where the API story starts. Reddit was a good base to build on top of, but it definitely did not fill every need of the users or moderators. However, reddit provided an API for free! People could request data from reddit's servers and manipulate it in any way they saw fit. This is where the community stepped in to create vital services that were required. u/automoderator, now built into reddit itself, was one such bot. It would be an insurmountable task to moderate reddit without tools like this.

People even did things beyond bots! Some built apps *because there was no official app*. Reddit just bought one of the apps the community created when they wanted to make one. Reddit was a website first and foremost, and an ugly one at that. To fix the ugliness of the site, reddit also supported theming with CSS, so community members could write their own CSS to theme their subreddits.

So, you should be catching on by now...

# The community built reddit

People that manage reddit suck, always have, and it's getting worse.

The first domino started falling when they created the new UI for reddit. Taking away the CSS that everyone worked so hard to create. Then they started pushing awards, hard. Started adding features nobody asked for (like predictions, wtf is that?). They took away direct lines of communication moderators had with admins to report major issues. Their app not only sucks, but is an accessibility nightmare. Conveniently, though, when the world lost their mind on NFTs, the admins were quick to implement their own. Their priorities are clearly skewed.

With reddit, one foot has always been planted firmly on the ""make money now"" accelerator, while the other has been on the ""we have no idea how to run a link aggregation site"" brakes. Reddit has lucked out and somehow failed upwards. They hit critical mass and out maneuvered their own hubris.

They want to call the shots now with the API without paying for the years of free development labor they have heavily benefited from or creating sufficient replacements for the tools they are killing.

Reddit, unfortunately, seems compelled to digg their own grave."
Too bad I won‚Äôt be on to see em
"Not sure how to feel, on the one hand I think y'all should join the blackout to send a message to Reddit, but on the other hand *only* allowing memes about the situation and how much Reddit fucked up is funnier.

Oh, and fuck Reddit and fuck u/spez for how they treated devs of third party apps like [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/)"
"I like it. People are still going to use reddit by the millions. If all the big subreddits go mute, the front page will just be a bunch of subs that don't give a fuck about the API changes.

Much better to fill it with memes about the issue at hand"
And they all have to be NSFW
"So, did I get this right, starting June 12 most of Reddit will stop existing as a part of protest or something, yeah?"
A W for dank memes moderators! Well call me sweet Bippy you did it congratulations!!
So where do we go after reddits demise? Is it fortnite? I never thought it had to end like this...
"Phew, I'd have nothing to do at work but this is going to be better than a blackout."
Are you on lemmy yet?
"""Gets back on Reddit after a few days""

Yo, what's neww....oh God!"
BET
"Omg this is so creative! Fully support!

But how am I supposed to see them if Im going to be away for 2 days???"
"People should fight battles to improve the world, but trying to fight too many battles will just lead people to being spread to thin to be happy or have an impact on any of them. So they have to choose their battles.

This is not a battle I choose to fight."
">digg their own grave

i see what you did there

&#x200B;

Also Fuck u/spez and r/reddit"
Admins gay
"And good! Deprive them of ad revenue they so desperately crave. 

The mods originally voted to go dark. Our reasons for doing this instead are:
* Casual browsers of reddit may see this appear on r/popular, rather than just other content they don't usually see since they aren't explicitly browsing r/dankmemes.
* Spreads awareness just in general of what's happening.
* Fewer ""where meme"" modmails.

We'll play it by ear after we start, though. We can change tactics if it seems dumb that we're not dark."
"i also wont be able to see them

but im not sad, they would come with so much spam anyway it wouldnt even be slightly worth it"
How do I delete my account
"We were thinking, on the day of the blackout, r/all is gonna still be filled with content from all the subs that are not participating in the protest, and it‚Äôll be content unrelated to the blackout (since y‚Äôknow, the subs that care will be blacked out). 

This way, if we only allow memes about the API situation, we can hopefully still get things to r/all and spread awareness for those just casually browsing while still protesting in our own way."
"June 12th is just the beginning. There really is no end date, so we'll play it by ear after a couple days of memes."
Many subreddits will be set to private. Which effectively means those subs will stop existing. People won't be able to post to them or view them. The posts won't be on your front page either.
"Temporarily, most subs are set to private for 48 hours."
I don‚Äôt know what a sweet bippy is but it makes a cool flair
"Reddit won‚Äôt end. Go outside and touch grass, everything will be fine"
"Realistically it probably won't die, it might just get shittyer. 

If Twitter is any example, it shows it's really fucking hard to move a social media user base inorganically, and even more difficult to make an effective clone/knock off site. 

What's kinda sad is that reddit's community is truely one of a kind (it's comment sections are more valuable than it's posts imo). Us all splitting to the wind would really deprive the internet of a cool thing that took 2 decades almost to build."
"> Deprive them of ad revenue they so desperately crave.

***laughs in adblock***"
Excellent response!
Hey I am using the new Reddit app. How do I permanently log off other than uninstalling
Definitely the best way to go for this sub.
100% support this decision and I can't think of a better sub to go this route
Absolute *geniuses*. Based mods indeed.
I think this is the best decision üôå
I was thinking of becoming inactive but this sounds much funnier
"I say keep it that way till July. Stick it to 'em. You know how all of us feel about this. u/spez didn't lose thousands of comment karma because we are happy with what is going on. The ""AMA"" doesn't have *zero* upvotes because the reddit community is content with what's happening to it.

Whatever we end up doing, you guys are making a beautiful decision. I never would have thought of this, but it's better than closing the sub for a while. Based mods."
"Understandable, tho I'd imagine after a week or so it'll become stale"
I can not believe they gave it to me.
"Everything ends eventually. MySpace, Facebook (still exists but honestly who really uses it) Digg... things stick around but there is always something else."
"Right??? It BLOWS MY MIND how many people don‚Äôt use any kind of ad blocker or haven‚Äôt even heard of such a thing. In the year 2023.

I installed ad block as soon as I heard about it being a thing, at least 10 years ago. Any time I use someone else‚Äôs laptop the internet just feels kind of‚Ä¶unclean

‚Äúcan I install ublock origin chrome extension on your laptop?‚Äù 

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a chrome extension?‚Äù


Just a quick google (didn‚Äôt verify) says about 30-40% use ad block on desktop/laptops.

For anyone without ad block, check out ublock origin: on [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), on [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), and on [edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak). The internet looks so much cleaner and loads much better."
"Me as well with Adblock, Ublock orgin etc

Also reddit's banned in My country, Bangladesh anyway"
"Look at your profile in the right slide out thingy. Then press the down arrow next to your name, then in the little thing the pops up press the log out button to the right of your account.

Like this: https://imgur.com/a/Jc0G7A5"
So what‚Äôs the something else
No one knows lol. Things happen organically. That doesn't mean any of what I said is false.
"But those sites you listed had other sites ready to take over, as of now there is no good alternative to reddit"
"Not quite. They were all the kings of their time. Digg in particular made a similar tone deaf decision, stuck with it, and died very much like reddit is doing. And they were the platform with no real good alternative of the time."
